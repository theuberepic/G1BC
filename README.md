The Gooper1 Building Creator (G1BC)
====

G1BC is a building creator made by two members of the Skyscraper Forum, TheUberEpic (me) and Gooper1.
It will be coded in JavaScript and HTML and *we hope* for a release date somewhere in the summer (of 2014).

Anyone who has used BBC will feel right at home with G1BC as the way you create buildings is the same. Although the interface has been tidied up.

**Read the wiki for info/help.**

No BBC code used!
